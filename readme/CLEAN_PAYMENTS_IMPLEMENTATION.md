Your current project flow is working correctly. You can safely remove the old `payment` app and use the new `payments` app.

### 2. ✅ **Clean Folder Structure**
All test scripts are now organized in `tests/` folder for clean project structure.

### 3. ✅ **Production Ready**
Your PhonePe V2 integration is production-ready with both UAT and production credentials configured.
