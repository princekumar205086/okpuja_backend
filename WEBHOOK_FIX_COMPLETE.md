# PhonePe Webhook Fix - Complete Solution

## 🚨 Issue Identified
The PhonePe webhook at `/api/payments/webhook/phonepe/` was failing with:
```json
{
    "error": "Webhook processing failed: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)",
    "success": false
}
```

## 🔍 Root Cause
The webhook was trying to parse JSON from empty or malformed request bodies, causing JSON parsing errors.

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. Enhanced Webhook Processing (`payment/gateways.py`)
- Added comprehensive error handling for empty request bodies
- Improved JSON parsing with detailed error messages
- Enhanced logging for debugging webhook issues
- Multiple fallback methods for extracting transaction IDs
- Flexible header handling (dict or string format)
- Better state/status detection from various callback formats

### 2. Improved Webhook View (`payment/views.py`)
- Added validation for empty request bodies
- Enhanced error responses with detailed information
- Comprehensive logging for webhook debugging
- Support for both GET (testing) and POST (actual webhook) requests
- Multiple header format support (X-VERIFY, Authorization, etc.)

### 3. Added Webhook Testing Script (`test_webhook.py`)
- Tests various webhook scenarios (empty, invalid, valid data)
- Validates webhook endpoint accessibility
- Provides sample PhonePe webhook payload testing

## 🔧 Key Improvements

### Before (Issues):
- ❌ Failed on empty request bodies
- ❌ Poor error messages
- ❌ Limited JSON parsing error handling
- ❌ Single method for extracting transaction data

### After (Fixed):
- ✅ Handles empty request bodies gracefully
- ✅ Detailed error messages and logging
- ✅ Robust JSON parsing with fallbacks
- ✅ Multiple methods for extracting transaction data
- ✅ Comprehensive webhook testing capabilities

## 📋 Configuration Verified

### PhonePe Webhook URL:
```
https://backend.okpuja.com/api/payments/webhook/phonepe/
```

### Environment Variables:
```bash
PHONEPE_CALLBACK_URL=https://backend.okpuja.com/api/payments/webhook/phonepe/
PHONEPE_SUCCESS_REDIRECT_URL=https://www.okpuja.com/confirmbooking/
PHONEPE_FAILED_REDIRECT_URL=https://www.okpuja.com/failedbooking
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Run Webhook Tests:
```bash
python test_webhook.py
```

### Manual Testing:
1. **GET Request**: `GET /api/payments/webhook/phonepe/` - Returns endpoint info
2. **Empty POST**: `POST /api/payments/webhook/phonepe/` - Returns appropriate error
3. **Valid Webhook**: PhonePe will send actual webhook data during payment

## 🔄 Expected Webhook Flow

1. **Payment Initiated**: User makes payment, gets redirected to PhonePe
2. **Payment Completed**: User completes payment on PhonePe
3. **Webhook Triggered**: PhonePe sends callback to our webhook URL
4. **Payment Updated**: Our system updates payment status
5. **Booking Created**: Successful payment triggers booking creation
6. **User Redirected**: User redirected to success/failure page

## 🎯 Success Criteria

- ✅ Webhook endpoint responds without errors
- ✅ Empty/invalid requests handled gracefully
- ✅ Valid PhonePe callbacks processed successfully
- ✅ Payment status updated correctly
- ✅ Booking creation triggered for successful payments

## 📞 Monitoring

### Check Webhook Logs:
```bash
sudo journalctl -u gunicorn_api_okpuja -f | grep webhook
sudo journalctl -u gunicorn_api_okpuja -f | grep PhonePe
```

### Webhook Health Check:
```bash
curl -X GET https://backend.okpuja.com/api/payments/webhook/phonepe/
```
