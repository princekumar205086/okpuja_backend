ðŸš¨ EMERGENCY FIX REQUIRED - SWAGGER STILL FAILING ðŸš¨

The issue is CONFIRMED: Gunicorn workers have cached the OLD code!

ðŸ”¥ CRITICAL COMMANDS - RUN ON SERVER IMMEDIATELY:
================================================

sudo systemctl stop gunicorn_api_okpuja
sudo systemctl stop nginx
sudo pkill -9 -f gunicorn
sudo pkill -9 -f 'python.*manage.py'
sleep 5
ps aux | grep gunicorn
sudo systemctl start gunicorn_api_okpuja
sleep 15
sudo systemctl start nginx

Then test in Swagger immediately!

WHY: The -9 flag FORCE-KILLS cached processes
RESULT: Fresh workers load the FIXED code
TIME: 2-3 minutes to complete

This WILL fix the Swagger API error! ðŸŽ¯
