ASTROLOGY BOOKING REDIRECT FIX - FINAL SUMMARY
===============================================

This script documents the complete fix for the astrology booking redirect issue.
The problem was that users were being redirected to the base URL instead of 
the proper astro-booking-success/failed pages with booking information.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
- After successful payment, users were redirected to base URL (e.g., www.okpuja.com)
- Expected redirect: https://www.okpuja.com/astro-booking-success?astro_book_id=ASTRO_BOOK_20250805_4734D7DB
- The redirect handler was using hardcoded settings.FRONTEND_BASE_URL instead of the stored frontend URL

ROOT CAUSE:
- The redirect handler was not using the frontend_redirect_url stored in payment metadata
- It was defaulting to settings.FRONTEND_BASE_URL for all redirects
- Astrology booking URLs were not being constructed with the stored frontend URL

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
1. Modified redirect handler to extract frontend_redirect_url from payment metadata
2. Use stored frontend URL as base for astrology booking redirects
3. Construct proper success/failure URLs with astro_book_id parameters
4. Maintain backward compatibility for regular bookings

FILES MODIFIED:
1. payments/redirect_handler.py - Enhanced to use frontend_redirect_url from metadata
2. astrology/views.py - Ensure frontend_redirect_url is stored in payment metadata

TESTING PERFORMED:
- Created comprehensive test scripts to validate redirect URL generation
- Tested both success and failure redirect scenarios
- Verified astro_book_id inclusion in redirect URLs
- Confirmed frontend URL extraction from metadata
