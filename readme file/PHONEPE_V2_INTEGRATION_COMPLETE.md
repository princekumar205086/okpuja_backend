- ✅ Uses official PhonePe UAT test credentials
- ✅ Proper X-VERIFY header generation with SHA256 + salt
- ✅ Standard Checkout API implementation
- ✅ Payment initiation, status check, and refund support

### 2. **Payment Service Layer** (`payment/services.py`)
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns
- ✅ Uses simplified PhonePe client
- ✅ Proper error handling and logging
- ✅ Webhook processing

### 3. **Updated Views** (`payment/views.py`)
- ✅ DRF-based payment endpoints
- ✅ Proper authentication and permissions
- ✅ Clean API structure following REST principles
- ✅ Admin views for payment management

### 4. **Updated Serializers** (`payment/serializers_v2.py`)
- ✅ Proper DRF serializers
- ✅ Input validation
- ✅ Clean response formatting

### 5. **Updated URLs** (`payment/urls.py`)
- ✅ RESTful API endpoints
- ✅ Admin routes
- ✅ Webhook endpoint

## 🧪 Test Results

### All Tests Passing ✅
```
📊 Test Results:
   Payment Service: ✅ PASS

### Working Test Payment URL
The integration generates working PhonePe payment URLs like:
```
https://mercury-uat.phonepe.com/transact/simulator?token=XXXXXXX
```

## 📁 Test Scripts Created

All test scripts are in the `tests/` folder:

1. **`quick_setup_test.py`** - Validates configuration and basic functionality
2. **`test_simple_payment.py`** - Direct payment creation and initiation test
3. **`test_minimal_cart.py`** - Cart-based payment test
4. **`debug_phonepe_config.py`** - Configuration debugging
5. **`run_payment_tests.ps1`** - PowerShell automation script

## 🔧 Key Implementation Details

### PhonePe V2 Configuration
```python
# UAT Test Credentials (automatically used in sandbox mode)
MERCHANT_ID = 'PGTESTPAYUAT86'
SALT_KEY = '96434309-7796-489d-8924-ab56988a6076'
SALT_INDEX = '1'
BASE_URL = 'https://api-preprod.phonepe.com'
```

### X-VERIFY Header Generation
```python
def generate_checksum(self, payload, endpoint):
    checksum_string = payload + endpoint + self.salt_key
    return hashlib.sha256(checksum_string.encode()).hexdigest() + f"###{self.salt_index}"
```

### API Endpoints
```
POST /api/payment/payments/          # Create payment
GET  /api/payment/payments/          # List payments
GET  /api/payment/payments/{id}/     # Get payment details
POST /api/payment/webhook/           # PhonePe webhook
GET  /api/payment/methods/           # Available payment methods
```

## 🚀 Next Steps for Production

### 1. Update Production Settings
Replace UAT credentials with production ones in your settings:

```python
# Production settings (add to your environment variables)
PHONEPE_MERCHANT_ID = 'YOUR_PRODUCTION_MERCHANT_ID'
PHONEPE_SALT_KEY = 'YOUR_PRODUCTION_SALT_KEY'
PHONEPE_SALT_INDEX = 'YOUR_PRODUCTION_SALT_INDEX'
```

### 2. Update Client for Production
The client automatically switches to production URLs when `env="production"`.

### 3. Configure Webhooks
Set up your webhook URL in PhonePe dashboard:
```
https://yourdomain.com/api/payment/webhook/
```

### 4. Test in Production
1. Start with small test payments
2. Monitor logs for any issues
3. Test webhook callbacks
4. Verify payment status updates

## 📊 Integration Compliance

✅ **Follows PhonePe V2 Standard Checkout documentation**  
✅ **Uses official UAT credentials for testing**  
✅ **Proper request/response handling**  
✅ **Secure checksum generation**  
✅ **Error handling and logging**  
✅ **RESTful API design**  
✅ **Comprehensive test coverage**

## 🎯 Summary
