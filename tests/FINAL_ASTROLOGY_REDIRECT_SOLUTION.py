FINAL ASTROLOGY REDIRECT FIX - COMPLETE SOLUTION
================================================

ISSUE RESOLVED:
✅ Astrology bookings were redirecting to: https://www.okpuja.com/confirmbooking?status=completed
✅ Now redirects correctly to: https://www.okpuja.com/astro-booking-success?astro_book_id=ASTRO_BOOK_XXXXXXXX

ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
1. Syntax error in redirect_handler.py (elif after else)
2. Missing proper astrology booking detection
3. Inconsistent frontend URL handling

FIXES APPLIED:
1. ✅ Fixed syntax error in redirect_handler.py
2. ✅ Enhanced astrology booking detection with logging
3. ✅ Standardized frontend URL to use https://www.okpuja.com (with www)
4. ✅ Changed URL parameter from merchant_order_id to astro_book_id
5. ✅ Added comprehensive logging for debugging
6. ✅ Maintained separation between puja and astrology redirects

TECHNICAL CHANGES:
- Fixed redirect_handler.py syntax (line 116)
- Enhanced logging with emoji indicators
- Default frontend URL: https://www.okpuja.com (with www)
- Success URL format: /astro-booking-success?astro_book_id=XXXX
- Failure URL format: /astro-booking-failed?astro_book_id=XXXX&reason=failed

TESTING COMPLETED:
✅ URL format validation passed
✅ Astrology detection working
✅ Puja service redirects unchanged
✅ Proper parameter naming
✅ Syntax errors resolved

DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST:
1. ✅ All test files moved to tests/ folder
2. ✅ Syntax validation passed
3. ✅ URL format matches requirements
4. ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
5. ✅ Production-ready code

TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE:
If still getting wrong redirects, check:
1. Payment metadata has 'booking_type': 'astrology'
2. AstrologyBooking exists with correct payment_id
3. Payment status is 'SUCCESS' (not 'FAILED')
4. Check Django logs for redirect_handler messages
5. Verify PhonePe webhook processed correctly

PRODUCTION TESTING:
1. Create new astrology booking
2. Complete payment via PhonePe
3. Should redirect to: https://www.okpuja.com/astro-booking-success?astro_book_id=ASTRO_BOOK_XXXXXXXX
4. Check logs for 🎯 ASTROLOGY REDIRECT messages

FILES MODIFIED:
- payments/redirect_handler.py (main fix)
- tests/ folder (all test files moved here)

FILES CREATED:
- tests/debug_astrology_redirect.py
- tests/test_final_redirect_fix.py
- tests/ASTROLOGY_REDIRECT_FIX_COMPLETE.py
