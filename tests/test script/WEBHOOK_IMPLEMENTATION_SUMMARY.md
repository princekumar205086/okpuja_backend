🎉 PHONEPE V2 WEBHOOK & BOOKING SYSTEM - IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY
================================================================

✅ ISSUES FIXED:
1. ❌ Webhook authentication was using Basic Auth instead of SHA256 hash
2. ❌ Webhook payload parsing was not following PhonePe V2 structure  
3. ❌ Booking creation was not triggered properly from webhooks
4. ❌ Email notifications were not being sent after booking creation
5. ❌ Cart cleanup and redirect handling needed optimization

✅ CURRENT WORKING SYSTEM:

🔐 WEBHOOK AUTHENTICATION (FIXED):
- Method: SHA256 hash of "username:password"
- Current Credentials: okpuja_webhook_user:Okpuja2025
- Expected Hash: 98c92a6e2291b7b46af7718015f287d895bc10f7add96dc3da06ae618b372d5b
- Format: Authorization: 98c92a6e2291b7b46af7718015f287d895bc10f7add96dc3da06ae618b372d5b

🔔 WEBHOOK PAYLOAD HANDLING (UPDATED):
- Supports PhonePe V2 format with "event" and "payload" structure
- Handles "checkout.order.completed" and "checkout.order.failed" events
- Relies on payload.state ("COMPLETED"/"FAILED") as per PhonePe docs
- Extracts transaction details from paymentDetails array

📋 BOOKING AUTO-CREATION (WORKING):
- Triggered automatically when webhook receives "checkout.order.completed"
- Creates booking from cart data after successful payment
- Generates unique booking ID with "BK-" prefix
- Updates cart status to "CONVERTED"
- Maintains proper relationships between cart, payment, and booking

📧 EMAIL NOTIFICATIONS (FUNCTIONAL):
- Sends confirmation emails to both user and admin
- Uses Gmail SMTP with working credentials
- Queued via Celery with immediate execution
- HTML templates with booking details

🔗 SMART REDIRECT HANDLING (ENHANCED):
- Uses cart_id instead of booking_id for redirect parameters
- Handles both production and sandbox payment flows
- Automatic booking creation during redirect if webhook missed
- Fallback mechanisms for various PhonePe response scenarios

🧹 CART CLEANUP (OPTIMIZED):
- Maintains maximum 3 converted carts per user
- Handles foreign key constraints properly
- Preserves booking data integrity during cleanup
- Transaction-based cleanup with error recovery

🧪 TESTING RESULTS:
✅ Webhook Authentication: WORKING
✅ Payload Processing: WORKING  
✅ Booking Creation: WORKING
✅ Email Notifications: WORKING
✅ Cart Cleanup: WORKING
✅ Redirect Handling: WORKING

🎯 COMPLETE FLOW VERIFICATION:
1. Cart Created → Payment Initiated → PhonePe Checkout
2. User Completes Payment → PhonePe Sends Webhook
3. Webhook Authenticated → Payment Marked Success
4. Booking Auto-Created → Email Sent → Cart Converted
5. User Redirected with cart_id → Booking Retrieved → Success Page

🔧 KEY FILES UPDATED:
- payments/webhook_auth.py (SHA256 authentication)
- payments/services.py (V2 webhook processing)
- payments/simple_redirect_handler.py (enhanced redirect logic)
- booking/models.py (total_amount property fixes)
- core/tasks.py (email notification system)

💡 IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Webhook URL must be configured in PhonePe dashboard with exact credentials
- System works with both UAT (sandbox) and production environments
- Email system requires Gmail SMTP to be properly configured
- Cart cleanup runs automatically to maintain performance
- All booking data is preserved even after cart cleanup

🚀 PRODUCTION READINESS: ✅ FULLY OPERATIONAL

Your booking system is now complete and ready for production use with proper PhonePe V2 webhook integration!
