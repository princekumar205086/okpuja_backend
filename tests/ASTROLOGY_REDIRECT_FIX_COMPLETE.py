FINAL SUMMARY: Astrology Service Redirect Fix
==============================================

PROBLEM FIXED:
- Astrology bookings were redirecting to puja service URLs
- FROM: https://www.okpuja.com/confirmbooking?status=completed  
- TO:   https://okpuja.com/astro-booking-success?merchant_order_id=ASTRO_BOOK_20250805_4734D7DB

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
1. ✅ Separated astrology and puja service redirect logic
2. ✅ Astrology bookings use their own redirect URLs  
3. ✅ Puja service redirects remain completely unchanged
4. ✅ Uses astro_book_id as merchant_order_id parameter

CHANGES MADE TO redirect_handler.py:
1. Added separate handling for booking_type == 'astrology'
2. Uses frontend_redirect_url from metadata (defaults to https://okpuja.com)
3. Redirects to /astro-booking-success or /astro-booking-failed
4. Uses astro_book_id as merchant_order_id parameter
5. Preserves all existing puja service redirect logic

URL FORMATS:
- Astrology Success: https://okpuja.com/astro-booking-success?merchant_order_id=ASTRO_BOOK_XXXXXXXX
- Astrology Failure: https://okpuja.com/astro-booking-failed?merchant_order_id=ASTRO_BOOK_XXXXXXXX&reason=failed
- Puja Success: https://www.okpuja.com/confirmbooking?book_id=XXXX&order_id=XXXX (unchanged)
- Puja Failure: existing failure URLs (unchanged)

TESTED AND VERIFIED:
✅ Astrology bookings redirect to correct URLs
✅ Puja service redirects remain unchanged  
✅ No interference between services
✅ Backward compatibility maintained
✅ Uses correct domain (okpuja.com vs www.okpuja.com)
✅ Includes astro_book_id as merchant_order_id
