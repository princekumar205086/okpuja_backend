## ✅ ALL REQUESTED FEATURES IMPLEMENTED

I have successfully implemented all your requested changes to fix the astrology booking system with proper payment integration and security features.

## 🔄 Key Changes Summary

### 1. **Model Enhancements** ✅

- ✅ **Auto-generation**: astro_book_id automatically generated with format `ASTRO_BOOK_YYYYMMDD_UNIQUEID`

### 2. **Payment Integration Fix** ✅

- ✅ **Atomic operations**: Payment and booking are properly linked
