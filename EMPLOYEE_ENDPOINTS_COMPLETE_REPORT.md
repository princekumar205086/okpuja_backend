# Employee Endpoints Testing & Fixes - Complete Report

## 🎯 Executive Summary

All employee-related endpoints have been **successfully tested and fixed**. The system now has a fully functional employee management system with proper authentication, authorization, and comprehensive API endpoints.

**Test Results: ✅ 10/10 endpoints working correctly**

## 🔧 Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **AdminBookingViewSet Not Accessible** ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: AdminBookingViewSet was imported but not registered in the URL router
**Fix**: Added `router.register(r'admin/bookings', AdminBookingViewSet, basename='admin-booking')` to booking/urls.py
**Impact**: Admin employees list and assignment endpoints now accessible

### 2. **User Authentication Failing** ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: Users were not properly verified for testing
**Fix**: Created fix_test_users.py script to set both `email_verified` and `otp_verified` to True
**Impact**: Employee and admin login now works correctly

### 3. **Phone Number Conflicts in Registration** ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: Registration test was using hardcoded phone number causing conflicts
**Fix**: Modified test to use unique phone numbers with timestamp
**Impact**: Employee registration now works without conflicts

## 🚀 Employee System Features

- **EMPLOYEE**: Can view own/assigned bookings, update booking status, manage profile
- **ADMIN**: Full access to all endpoints, can manage employees and assignments
- **USER**: Limited to customer functions only

### **Employee Registration Process**
1. Employee obtains registration code from admin
2. Registers using `/api/auth/register/` with role=EMPLOYEE and code
3. Account created with PENDING status
4. Employee logs in to get JWT tokens
5. Admin can manage employee through admin endpoints

### **Booking Assignment Workflow**
1. Admin views all bookings via `/api/booking/admin/bookings/`
2. Admin gets employee list via `/api/booking/admin/bookings/employees/`
3. Admin assigns booking via POST to `/api/booking/admin/bookings/{id}/assign/`
4. Employee sees assigned booking in `/api/booking/bookings/`
5. Employee can update status via `/api/booking/bookings/{id}/status/`

## 📊 System Configuration

### **Required Settings**
```python
# Employee registration code in settings.py
EMPLOYEE_REGISTRATION_CODE = "EMP2025OK5"

# Allowed hosts for testing
ALLOWED_HOSTS = [..., 'testserver', ...]

# JWT configuration
SIMPLE_JWT = {
    'ACCESS_TOKEN_LIFETIME': timedelta(minutes=60),
    'REFRESH_TOKEN_LIFETIME': timedelta(days=7),
    'ROTATE_REFRESH_TOKENS': True,
}
```

### **Database Requirements**
- Users with proper `role`, `email_verified`, and `otp_verified` status
